The project involved implementing a database management system where a local connection was established to the database. Data was then obtained from an API and processed to ensure it is clean and relevant. The cleaned data was then inserted into the database using the established connection.

Further, in the project, a specific column in the database named "tweet" was processed using tokenization, lemmatization, and word cloud techniques. Tokenization involves breaking down sentences or phrases into smaller units or tokens to enable easier analysis. Lemmatization, on the other hand, involves converting words to their base or root form to enhance analysis. Word cloud techniques help to visualize frequently occurring words or phrases in a particular text corpus, making it easier to identify significant patterns and trends.

In the analysis section, the project involved extracting and processing data from the database using various techniques and tools. Specifically, the project aimed to identify the maximum number of tweets based on user location. This analysis involved using data manipulation tools to extract relevant information from the database, such as user location and the number of tweets associated with each location. The extracted data was then analyzed using statistical techniques to identify the location with the highest number of tweets.

In this project, the database was managed starting from establishing a connection to the database. After establishing a local connection, the data obtained from an API was cleaned and inserted into the database. Later, the tweet column was tokenized, lemmatized and analyzed using word cloud techniques. In the analysis section, the maximum number of tweets was analyzed based on user location. This involved extracting and processing data from the database using various techniques and tools.
